<h3 class="header-y">TRIDE Company</h3>
<p>Founded in 2007 TRIDE building company has grown into a dynamically developing organization that has been implementing large-scale projects in the development market. TRIDE develops innovative and original designs that combine the requirements of modern architecture with the customer’s needs and desires.</p>

<p>The modern-standard multi-storey residential building on Gorgasali Street in Batumi represents the first successful project implemented by TRIDE. This very project raised the customer’s trust and confidence in TRIDE company, because, besides high-quality construction works, the customers have accepted apartments in scheduled timeframes, while this aspect remains one of the problematic issues in the Georgian Development sector.</p>

<p>In 2010 TRIDE launched a larger-scale project implementation for constructing a residential complex of Dighomi Park. The construction site is located on Ljubljana Street in Tbilisi, in the vicinity of the Dighomi woodland park, on 33 500 square meter space, of which, after the project completion, 28 800 square meter territory will be transformed into a green zone. In 2-3 years the Dighomi Park will function as an independent European-standard residential Green Block in Tbilisi to accommodate more than 1 000 families and provide its own infrastructural facilities and services.</p>

<p>Over the years TRIDE’s team unites qualified and experienced professionals. Today the company employs more than 200 citizens, cooperates with more than 10 contractual companies. TRIDE relies on strong and firm financial fundament and this factor guarantees timely completion of all construction projects.</p>
<p>TRIDE’s closest plans are not limited by only the Dighomi Park. The company also intends to build hotel-style residential house in Bakuriani and residential buildings in various districts of Tbilisi.</p>

<h3 class="header-y">The Director's Message</h3>
<p><img src="img/icons/logo.png" class="img-responsive thumbnail" alt="Dimitri Gokhelashvili"> Nowadays the real estate market records sharp competition. However, I believe our company is successfully coping with this process, because we offer entirely different products to the customers. This is the Dighomi Park residential complex.</p>

<p>Today, we have completed, put into exploitation and accommodated customers into 7 buildings of the complex: Sections A, B, C, Green House, Panorama 1, Panorama 2 and Panorama 3. This is a residential space on 60 000 square meter space with about 600 accommodated families.</p>

<p>Eventually, the Dighomi Park complex will give room to more than 1000 families. Consequently, the project calls for constructing additional 40 000 square meter residential space on the residential complex territory.</p>

<p>In this instance, TRIDE development company introduces Panorama 2, the new sixth building of the Dighomi Park complex. The fashionable building constructed by modern technologies and materials provides more comfort to you. Unlike all other projects, Panorama 2 is based on energy efficiency technologies. High-quality insulation materials guarantee valuable heating environment and you will considerably cut heating-cooling costs.</p>

<p>The reception hall coated by top-quality natural stones, vertical chain glass structures, panorama elevator and individual terraces will provide you with guaranteed comfortable lifestyle.</p>
